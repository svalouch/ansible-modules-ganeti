Ansible modules for Ganeti
##########################

**Warning**: This module is no longer maintained and has not been tested with recent versions of Ganeti.

This is a small collection of modules that use the JSON API of Ganetis RAPI daemon. Use at your own risk!

Overview
********
Ganeti comes with a JSON API that is managed by their Remote API (RAPI) daemon. By default RAPI listens on "localhost"
on the `manager node` and uses a self-signed certificate, but can be configured to listen to other addresses and use
a proper certificate. Configuring this is outside of this projects scope.

The API is documented here: `<http://docs.ganeti.org/ganeti/2.16/html/rapi.html>`_

Dependencies / expected environment
***********************************
The modules are developed against version **2.16** of Ganeti and thus RAPI, running on a Debian Buster (10) host. The
Python interpreter is assumed to be Python 3.7 (as is standard on Debian Buster). While the code does not use features
introduced after Python 3.5, no care is taken to remain backwards compatible with earlier Python versions, especially
not **2.x**. It is also tested to work on Ansible **2.9**.

Authentication
**************
The modules connect to RAPI using TLS, setting up the trust store on the host may be required if you use your own CA
or the self-signed certificate (refer to the **requests** documentation for insights).

RAPI uses a users file to map usernames to both passwords and permissions. The default location is 
``/var/lib/ganeti/rapi/users``. Each line configures one user. Permissions are either read, write, or both. The
password is the concatenation of the username, the fixed string ``:Ganeti Remote API:`` and the password. It can be
created using the following `jinja2` template, assuming ``ganeti_rapi_users`` is a hash with ``name``, ``password``
and ``access`` keys:

.. code-block::

   {% for user in ganeti_rapi_users %}
   {% set string = user.name ~ ':Ganeti Remote API:' ~ user.password %}
   {{ user.name }} {HA1}{{ string | hash('md5') }}{% if user.access %} {{ user.access }}{% endif %}
   {% endfor %}

Modules
*******
All modules use the following variables to connect:

* ``user`` is the username
* ``password`` is the users password, it is protected using ``no_log=True``
* ``address`` is the address on which RAPI listens, and defaults to ``localhost``
* ``port`` is the port at which RAPI listens, defaulting to ``5080``

ganeti_instance
===============
As the name implies, the module manages instances. It is used to create, start, stop and remove instances. Support for
migration, modification and import is not present yet.

The module was inspired by `kafeinnet/ansible-ganeti <https://github.com/kafeinnet/ansible-ganeti>`_ but is a new
implementation using more modern libaries such as requests.

The module allows to wait for job completion. If ``wait`` is `true`, the module waits for the tasks completion. The
amount of time to wait at most is set using ``job_timeout`` in seconds, the default is **5 minutes**. If the job does
not finish within that time frame, the module returns an error (usually ending the playbook), but it does not clean
up. This means that an instance could have been successfully created eventually, and it is up to the user to determin
if and what to clean up.
If ``wait`` is `false`, the module is in fire-and-forget mode and will return as soon as the response from RAPI is
received.

.. todo:: return job id

state: present
--------------
The state is used to create a new instance. It has features an extensive parameter set, but does not implement **all**
of the parameters that RAPI understands. It performs some validation, for example a list of possible `disk templates`
and `hypervisor choices` is coded into it, representing the state of Ganeti 2.16. Most parameters are optional, but
some like ``name`` are mandatory. In the end, the configuration and defaults set on the cluster, node and instance os
determin what is required to create an instance and detecting that is outside the modules scope.

Complex example, the comments denote the parameter that would normally go to ``gnt-instance create`` on the shell:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: create test vm
      ganeti_instance:
          user: ansible
          password: "ansible"
          name: testvm
          state: present
          memory: 1024
          # -B vcpus=2
          vcpus: 2

          disk_template: ext
          disks:

            - size: 10G
              name: root

            - size: 1G

            # netmode=manual
            netmode: manual
          nics:
            # --net 0:mode=bridged,name=server,link=br_ext,ip=192.168.90.14
            - mode: bridged
              name: server

            # --net 1:mode=bridged,name=server_int,link=br_int,ip=192.168.80.14
            - mode: bridged
              name: server_int
              link: br_host
              ip: 192.168.80.14

state: absent
-------------
The ``absent`` state is used to remove an instance, akin to ``gnt-instance remove``. Thus, this **can't be undone**.
it is not required to power the instance down beforehand, Ganeti will handle that. ``name`` is the only required
parameter.

state: started
--------------
Starts the instance if it is down, and does nothing if it is running. Same as ``gnt-instance start``. ``name`` is the
only required parameter. Returns an error if the instance does not exist.

state: stopped
--------------
Shuts the instance down, the same as executing ``gnt-instance stop``. A timeout can't be given (yet) and the only
required parameter is ``name``. Does nothing if the instance is not running. Returns an error if the instance does not
exist.

state: restarted
================
Restarts the instance, or starts it if it was down. This is analog to running ``gnt-instance restart``. It requires
the ``name`` of the instance. Returns an error if the instance does not exist.
